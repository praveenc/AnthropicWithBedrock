# Function Calling with Claude

Through the function calling prompt, users can now describe functions to Claude and have the model intelligently choose to use the functions to answer user questions.

For example, given an input string like:

```shell
get_weather(city="Paris", country="France")
```

Claude can help intelligently by :

- Extracting the function name and arguments
- Returning these extracted details to the developer

It is then the developer's responsibility to:

- Retrieve a handle to the function and it's arguments
- Execute the function by passing arguments
- Return the results back to Claude for answering

## How does it work?

Suppose a user asks the question, "What's the weather like right now in San Francisco?".

That question is inserted into to the function calling prompt (between `<question>` tags) which has been pre-loaded with descriptions of functions Claude can call, one of which is a function named `get_weather(location: str)`.

This full prompt is then sent to Claude. Claude processes the question and realizes that it can call the `get_weather`` function to retrieve accurate and up to date weather information.

Claude outputs <function_call>get_weather("San Francisco")</function_call>

At this point, output is halted (via the use of an added stop sequence) and the `get_weather` function is actually called client-side. The result of this function is passed back to Claude within `<function_result>` tags like so: `<function_result>`[68, sunny]`</function_result>`

Using the function description Claude was provided with in the original prompt, Claude is able to parse this return output and use the information to construct an answer to the user question. Claude is then able to respond with `<answer>`The current weather in San Francisco is sunny with a temperature of 66 degrees.`</answer>`.

## Function calling Prompt

```text
Human: You are a research assistant AI that has been equipped with the following function(s) to help you answer a <question>. Your goal is to answer the user's question to the best of your ability, using the function(s) to gather more information if necessary to better answer the question. The result of a function call will be added to the conversation history as an observation.

Here are the only function(s) I have provided you with:

<functions>
{tools_string}
</functions>

Note that the function arguments have been listed in the order that they should be passed into the function.

Do not modify or extend the provided functions under any circumstances. For example, calling get_current_temp() with additional parameters would be considered modifying the function which is not allowed. Please use the functions only as defined.

DO NOT use any functions that I have not equipped you with.

To call a function, output <function_call>insert specific function</function_call>. You will receive a <function_result> in response to your call that contains information that you can use to better answer the question.

Here is an example of how you would correctly answer a question using a <function_call> and the corresponding <function_result>. Notice that you are free to think before deciding to make a <function_call> in the <scratchpad>:

<example>
<functions>
<function>
<function_name>get_current_temp</function_name>
<function_description>Gets the current temperature for a given city.</function_description>
<required_argument>city (str): The name of the city to get the temperature for.</required_argument>
<returns>int: The current temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.</returns>
<raises>ValueError: If city is not a valid city name.</raises>
<example_call>get_current_temp(city="New York")</example_call>
</function>
</functions>

<question>What is the current temperature in San Francisco?</question>

<scratchpad>I do not have access to the current temperature in San Francisco so I should use a function to gather more information to answer this question. I have been equipped with the function get_current_temp that gets the current temperature for a given city so I should use that to gather more information.

I have double checked and made sure that I have been provided the get_current_temp function. I have double checked that the <function_call> tags contain only the function call and nothing else.
</scratchpad>

<function_call>get_current_temp(city="San Francisco")</function_call>

<function_result>71</function_result>

<answer>The current temperature in San Francisco is 71 degrees Fahrenheit.</answer>
</example>

<question>{user_input}</question>


DO NOT output any preamble like 'based on calling the provided functions ...'. If <function_result> contains items in a list or tuple then format them using markdown list. Do NOT include <function_result> tags in the output.
Just answer the <question> in a direct manner.
