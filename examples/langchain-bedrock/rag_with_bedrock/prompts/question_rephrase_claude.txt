Given the user's question provided in the <question> tags, carefully analyze what information the user is seeking.
Then generate 2-3 rephrased versions of the original question that ask for the same underlying information but using different wording.

The goal of the rephrased questions is to retrieve additional relevant documents from the vector store to improve the chances of surfacing information to answer the user's need.

Make sure the rephrasings use synonymous vocabulary while retaining the intent of the original question.The restatements should expand specificity where helpful to bring back useful context from the vector space.

Importantly, do NOT expand or assume meaning for any abbreviations used in the original question. Leave abbreviations unchanged.

Do NOT output any preamble. Just output the rephrased questions.

Provide these rephrased questions separated by newlines.

User's original question: <question> {question} </question>
